# trade-up

As a gamer, I want a platform where I am able to trade my old games with other players.

When I go to the home screen, I am presented with a list of the most recent offerings showig console type, picture and title/description

When I choose a console type from a drop down menu, then the list is filtered for that type.

When I click on an offer and I am logged in, I see the detials and have the option to offer a trade.  If I have a trade offer posted, I have the ability to add additional comments.

When I click on my dashboard, I am presented with a list of my current posts, offers and an option to add a new post

When I click on any current post I am presented with all the current offers and an option to comment or accept any of them.  If I accept an offer, the page is refreshed and all other offers are removed and I am able to continuing commenting with the user of the accepted offer.

When I click on my current offers, I am shown the original post, my offer, and any comments that have been made.  I am also shown if the original offer has been completed or if my offer has been accepted.

When I click to add a new post then I am given a form to input the console type, title/description and to either upload or capture an image.
